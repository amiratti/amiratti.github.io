            Join us for our tree identification walking tour through Brooklyn!
        </div>
            Get to know your tree neighbors, with your human (and more than human) neighbors. We’ll be strolling through Brower Park to identify the trees that provide shade, ecologies, and homes for species of all kinds. We'll practice our observational skills through writing and sketching and learn about our shared past and future with them in a time of unprecedented global ecosystems change. We’ll discuss the science behind fall color and begin to notice their autumnal changes as our trees prepare for winter.
