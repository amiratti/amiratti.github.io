            Celebrate Arbor Day with a tree identification walk along Nostrand Avenue!

        <div id = "objective-2">
        Get to know your tree neighbors, with your human (and more than human) neighbors. We’ll be checking in on our neighborhood street trees with a stroll up Nostrand Avenue to identify the trees that provide shade, ecologies, and homes for species of all kinds. We’ll be learning how to identify and care for trees, sharing stories of their cultural histories, and discussing our shared future with them in a time of unprecedented global ecosystems change.
