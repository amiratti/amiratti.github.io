        Chair Shair was a group exhibition organized by Conrad Moore and Alya Miratti Ardianto, bringing together twenty artists to question and redefine the chair as a design object. The project was both an exploration of the chair’s physical parameters through product design and fabrication, as well as a conceptual investigation of the chair’s cultural omnipresence. 
<br><br>
        Chair Shair invited a wide range of makers to develop new work or show existing pieces, the only guidelines being that they are “physical, sittable objects”. The space was taken over by this ubiquitous building block of the everyday, acting as an open invitation for passerby to share chairs and become part of the exhibition themselves. 
        <br><br>
        The exhibition ran from April 8 to April 12, 2025 at The Cooper Union’s Foundation Building.
