   <div id = "moss-text"> one day she decides she no longer wished to participate.  so she stares and stares and stares into nothingness until moss creeps into the edges of her vision. if she moves an inch sheâ€˜ll scare them away. so she stills and begins to collect dust. soon she won't even steal a breath. eventually time loses its shape. daysmonthsyears slip past quietly. she dissolves into the moss.</div>
