        Pink is not the shade of buttercups or daisies. 
        <hr>
        It is the color of poisonous brugmansia blooms, of poppies that bring on sleep.
        <hr> 
        Pink saturates the face in anger. 
        <hr>
        It is the cast left on a cutting board by a hunk of uncooked meat. 
        <hr>
        Pink, too, is the bittersweet shade of passion subdued, passion that has slipped from burgundy to rose. 
        <hr>

        <hr>
        It is the tint that drifts away unnoticed in the night.
